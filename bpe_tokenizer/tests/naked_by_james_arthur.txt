Hey you there

But all you ever do is mess it up

That getting half of you just aint enough
Im not going to wait until youre done
Pretending you dont need anyone
Im standing here naked
Naked naked

Naked naked
Im not going to try til you decide
Youre ready to swallow all your pride
Im standing here naked

Im trying to make it clear
Getting half of you just aint enough
Im not going to wait until youre done
Pretending you dont need anyone
